# GNURadio and Go

This repository contains a GNURadio Out of Tree Module (gr-goblocks) with a block written in the Go programming language. It can be installed with CMake just like any other GNURadio OOT, with the only extra dependency being the Go tool for compiling Go code. It serves as a proof of concept, demonstrating the possibility of using Go as an alternative programming language for writing OOT blocks, as a compromise between Python's ease of use and C++'s raw performance.
